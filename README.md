[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/okfn/a/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/okfn/a)

This is a new repository only to be used for read-only web assets. This repository should be as light as possible.

When files are added here, Travis automatically pushes them to the S3 bucket that serves https://a.okfn.org

Never add a file directly onto master: always do a PR so someone else can verify the file belongs here.

What does belong here:

- images, css and html that is used across multiple OKI web properties

What does not belong here:

- Javascript libraries
- Presentations
- General documents
- Images for blog posts
